### My Reflection
This is my first JavaScript project (I've been coding in Java prior to this), so my goal behind this was just to learn the basics. The reason I am pursuing JavaScript is that I am not able to deploy my Java projects to the web. I also feel that drawing stuff is far easier in JavaScript than Java. Now, after this project, I am able to link HTML to JavaScript. On JavaScript I now know the basics, in addition, I am quite comfortable with drawing to a Canvas. Prior to this, I needed to reference documentation to accomplish basic tasks, now I am proficient enough to write without documentation. One thing I struggled with in this project was responding to multiple key clicks at the same time. The default key listener can only record one key at a time, so to get over that I has to store the key clicked into an array, then read from that array. Another thing I struggled at first was how to store where every object was (the aliens and all the laser beams), I accomplished this using an array of objects, one array for the enemies and another for the lasers. This solution was really effective, and I will be doing the same in future projects. 
#### What I Want to Improve On
For starters, I'm going to try to get familiar with the syntax with JavaScript. I also want to find out how to import custom fonts, this task shouldn't be particularly difficult. I need to learn more HTML and CSS and how to tie that well with JavaScript.
